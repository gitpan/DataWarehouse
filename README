Perl-Data-Warehouse-Toolkit

A Data Warehouse (DW) is a repository of an organization's data, designed
to facilitate reporting and analysis at different levels of aggregation.

The main source of the data is extracted, cleaned, transformed, and made
available to managers and other business professionals for data mining,
online analytical processing, market research and decision support.

Perl is a language optimized for scanning arbitrary text files,
extracting information from those text files, and printing reports
based on that information.  It's also a good language for many system
management tasks.  The language is intended to be practical (easy to use,
efficient, complete) rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant, minimal).

The Perl Data Warehouse Toolkit goal is to make simple ETL and DW tasks
easy, and complex tasks possible.
