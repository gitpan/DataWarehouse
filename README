DataWarehouse

Perl is a language optimized for scanning arbitrary text files, extracting
information from those text files, and generating reports based on that
information. It's also a good language for many system management tasks.
The language is intended to be practical (easy to use, efficient,
complete) rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant, minimal).

A Data Warehouse (DW) is a repository of an organization's data, designed
to facilitate reporting and analysis at different levels of aggregation.

The main source of the data is extracted, cleaned, transformed, and made
available to managers and other business professionals for data mining,
online analytical processing, market research and decision support. This
process is called ETL (Extract/Transform/Load).

The Perl Data Warehouse Toolkit is a generic set of tools created to
manage Data Warehouses meta-information, making simple ETL and DW tasks
easy, and complex tasks possible.
